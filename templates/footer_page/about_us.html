        <p class="section-text">
            CR Reviews is Bangladesh's first student-driven platform dedicated to promoting transparency 
            and accountability in university leadership. We believe that every student deserves to have 
            their voice heard and every Course Representative (CR) deserves honest feedback to grow and improve.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Why We Started</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            As students ourselves, we noticed a gap in communication and feedback systems within universities. 
            Many students felt unheard and CRs often lacked constructive feedback to improve their performance. 
            CR Reviews was born from the desire to bridge this gap and create a supportive community where 
            everyone can contribute to a better academic environment.
